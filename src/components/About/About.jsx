            My coding journey began with a course at{' '}
            <a href='https://www.shecodes.io/' target='_blank'>
              SheCodes
            </a>{' '}
            that left me wanting to learn more. After more self study, I
            participated in a Software Engineering Immersive at{' '}
            <a href='https://generalassemb.ly/' target='_blank'>
              General Assembly
            </a>
            . Through this process I was able to refine my skills in problem
            solving, time management, and creativity. I discovered my passion
            for bringing both the technical and visual aspects of applications
            to life. User experience and writing clean code are important to me.
            Details matter!

        <p>My passion for web development was sparked when I participated in the process of building a website. I decided it was time to start my coding journey. I then completed a Software Engineering program at General Assembly where I was able to refine my problem solving skills, time management skills, and creativity.  I am now an eager Junior Web Developer looking to continue to grow my skills. Iâ€™m passionate about using innovative technologies to craft quality web applications.</p>
